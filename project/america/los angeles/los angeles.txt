1. Introduction
Located on Southern California's Pacific coast, Los Angeles has long been known as a city of dreams, a place for the dispossessed or
 disillusioned to start over and rebuild their lives. In the course of the twentieth century it grew to be the second-largest city in the United States 
and the hub of a five-county metropolitan area. A tourist magnet known for its sunny climate, beautiful beaches, and entertainment industry, 
Los Angeles in recent decades has experienced the downside of urban expansion, with its well-publicized air pollution, traffic congestion,
 and racial and ethnic tensions. Yet the city remains a colorful, thriving metropolis working to overcome the problems of suburban sprawl as it heads into a
 new century.

2. Getting There
Los Angeles is located in southern California, on the Pacific Coast, with the Santa Monica Mountains to the north and the San Gabriel Mountains to the east.

Highways
Los Angeles is known for its crowded, labyrinthine freeway system, which offers access to the city through multiple north-south and east-west routes. 
The major north-south highways are I-5 (the Golden State and Santa Ana freeways), I-15 (which extends from the Canadian border to San Diego), 
US Highway 101 (the Ventura and Hollywood freeways), extending south along the Pacific coast from Washington State, and State Highway 1 
(the Pacific Coast Highway), stretching along the coast from San Diego to San Francisco and beyond. East-west freeways include I-8, 
which runs between California and Arizona, I-10 (the San Bernardino and Santa Monica freeways), which traverses the country between Santa Monica 
and Jacksonville, Florida, and I-40, stretching from California to Tennessee.

Bus and Railroad Service
Amtrak provides service from Union Station in downtown Los Angeles. The Sunset Limited travels cross-country between Los Angeles and New Orleans;
 the Coast Starlight, as its name suggests, follows a coastal route from southern California to Seattle; the San Diegan runs from Los Angeles to San Diego.

Airports
Los Angeles International Airport, known locally as LAX, is located on the west side of the city. With flights to over 60 major cities, 
it is the world's third-busiest airport when it comes to passenger service.

Shipping
Due in large part to trade with the countries of the Pacific Rim, the Los Angeles/Long Beach Port System is the country's top-ranked 
shipping port in terms of both volume and value of goods handled. The Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is a top shipping facility for air cargo.
 As the point of termination for several major rail lines, Los Angeles is also a busy rail freight center, and the city is also served by all major interstate trucking
 companies.

3. Getting Around
What most people refer to when they say "Los Angeles" is more a sprawling collection of suburbs than a single city laid out according to an orderly plan. 
Nevertheless, Los Angeles does have a downtown, an area largely bounded by the Harbor Freeway, the Santa Monica Freeway, and Alameda street, 
with numbered streets running northwest to southeast, with several avenues running in the perpendicular direction. Located in this district are the
 Los Angeles City Hall, the Convention Center, the Los Angeles County Court, the Civic Centre, and the Museum of Contemporary Art.
