Pusan, also spelled Busan, metropolitan city and port, South Korea, located at the southeast tip of the Korean peninsula. 
 It is bordered to the north and west by South Kyongsang (South Gyeongsang) province (do); to the south and east lies the Korea Strait. 
During the Koryo dynasty (935–1392) it was named Pusanp’o (Korean pu meaning “kettle” and san meaning “mountain,” for the shape of the mountain
 at whose foot it is situated, and p’o meaning “bay” or “harbour”). Pusan is the country’s largest port and second largest city. It has the status of a metropolitan
 city under the direct control of the central government, with administrative status equal to that of a province.

n a deep well-sheltered bay at the mouth of the Naktong River, facing the Japanese islands of Tsushima across the Korea Strait,
 Pusan was opened to the Japanese in 1876 and to general foreign trade in 1883. Under the Japanese occupation (1910–45) it developed into a modern port;
 ferry service connected the city with Shimonoseki, Japan, and Pusan was the terminus of rail lines connecting Korea to China and Russia. 
The city became overpopulated with repatriates from overseas when Korea gained independence in 1945 and again with refugees during the 
Korean War (1950–53), when it was the temporary capital of the Republic of Korea.

The port is divided by Yong (Yeong) Island, which is connected to the mainland by drawbridge.
 The larger eastern section of the port is used for foreign trade and the smaller western section for fishing. 
Construction on a new container port and distribution centre, located slightly west of the original port, began in the late 1990s on
 Kadok (Gadeok) Island and nearby areas of the mainland; the first phase of the new port opened in 2006.
