
Japan's first permanent capital was established in the year 710 at Heijo, the city now known as Nara (??). As the influence and political ambitions 
of the city's powerful Buddhist monasteries grew to become a serious threat to the government, the capital was moved to Nagaoka in 784 and a few 
years later to Kyoto.

Nara is located less than one hour from Kyoto and Osaka. Due to its past as the first permanent capital, it remains full of historic treasures
, including some of Japan's oldest and largest temples.



Todaiji (???, Todaiji, "Great Eastern Temple") is one of Japan's most famous and historically significant temples and a landmark of Nara.
 The temple was constructed in 752 as the head temple of all provincial Buddhist temples of Japan and grew so powerful that the capital was moved from 
Nara to Nagaoka in 784 in order to lower the temple's influence on government affairs.

Todaiji's main hall, the Daibutsuden (Big Buddha Hall) is the world's largest wooden building, despite the fact that the present reconstruction of 1692
 is only two thirds of the original temple hall's size. The massive building houses one of Japan's largest bronze statues of Buddha (Daibutsu). 
The 15 meters tall, seated Buddha represents Vairocana and is flanked by two Bodhisattvas.
