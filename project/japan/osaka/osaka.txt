 Osaka 

Osaka is Japan's third biggest city, and the metropolis of the Kansai region. Osaka is a port city, and historically the merchant capital of Japan. 
The traditional greeting among citizens of this friendly, unpretentious "work hard, party hard" city is mohkare-makka, or "Are you making money?". 
Visitors will appreciate the more neighborly ethos of Osaka, in contrast to the mind-your-own-business mood of Tokyo.

Osaka has long identified itself by kuidaore ("ruinous eating") as opposed to Kyoto's kidaore ("ruinous dressing"), and there are several Osaka-born
 dishes that you must try, starting with the okonomiyaki savory pancake, if you are to say you have experienced Osaka.

Osaka's main centers are laid out north-south, making it easy to navigate and sample the various atmospheres, from the glitzier north to the earthier south.

The other main cities of the Kansai region: Kyoto, Nara and Kobe are all less than an hour by train from Osaka.

Things to see and do in Osaka
In the late 1980's and early 1990's the Kansai area with Osaka at its heart was producing 5% of the world's GDP. Those heady days may have passed as
 the Kansai area and Osaka have been overtaken by such mega-cities as Shanghai, Shenzhen and Tianjin in China but Osaka and its hinterland of the Kansai
 region still remain a powerhouse in the Japanese economy.
